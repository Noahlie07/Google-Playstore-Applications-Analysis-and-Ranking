# Google-Playstore-Applications-Analysis-and-Ranking
Utilized Python and its extensive libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to conduct exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information regarding applications on Google Playstore. Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and sentiment analysis in the process.

## Purpose of this Project
This project's overarching objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis on applications in Google Playstore, and ultimately create a ranking system of the applications based on four criteria; popularity, novelty, likability, and unique strengths.

## Accessing this Project
It is recommended to go through AndroidAppsComprehensiveAnalysis.ipynb, as this file contains the step-by-step procedures of this project, including the final results. PythonPandasAndroidAppProject.py contains all the code used for this project. It is unnecessary to go through this file as the former file already explains all of the code used in better detail.

## Skills Demonstrated
Skills: Python Pandas, Python Numpy, Python Scikit-Learn, Python Matplotlib

## Datasets Used
Two datasets are used for this project.
One dataset contains details regarding each applications, including the following columns: ['App', 'Category', 'Rating', 'Reviews', 'Size', 'Installs', 'Type', 'Price', 'Content Rating', 'Genres', 'Last Updated', 'Current Ver', 'Android Ver'].
